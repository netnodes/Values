## NetNodes Homeworking Policy

### Introduction

This Homeworking Policy does not form part of any employee’s contract and can be amended or withdrawn at any time.

NetNodes defines home working as where the employee’s contractual base working location is the employees’ home address. 

Some NetNodes' staff are currently predominantly “Home workers” who maintain communication via regular video conferences, face to face liaison meetings, occasional social events, training workshops and events, telephone contact and email. 

However, when considering homeworking the needs of our organisation will always take priority. Those who are currently required or allowed to work from home must comply with this policy and we reserve the right to amend an employee’s work location, with appropriate communication and consultation, as per their contract of employment.

 This policy is sets out how we aim to manage homeworking and the responsibilities of both NetNodes and the home worker.

### Scope of this policy

This policy applies to all home-based employees and workers.
 
### Aims of this policy

This policy aims to ensure that home-based working arrangements are properly considered and are managed in a fair and consistent manner which also recognises our health and safety responsibilities for home-based workers.

### Legal considerations

The following pieces of legislation apply to this policy: 

- Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974
- Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
- Display Screen Equipment Regulations 1992
- Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992
- Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998
- Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended) (COSHH)
- Data Protection Act 2018

### Suitability

The employee’s line manager is responsible for ensuring that the worker has the necessary skills and personal qualities and is able to provide an adequate workspace in the home. They will be required to comply with a number of health and safety factors including fire safety, first aid provision, ergonomic considerations, adequate space, safety considerations, insurance and secure storage facilities as well as broadband provision.

### Health and safety

The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HASAWA) places duties on employers, self-employed people and employees; employers have a duty to protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees, including home workers.

Most health and safety legislation applies to home workers as well as to employees working at an employer's workplace. These include, for example, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (under which employers are required to undertake a risk assessment of the work activities carried out by home workers), the Display Screen Equipment Regulations 1992, the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992, the Provision of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002.

Home workers themselves must also take reasonable care of their own health and safety and that of anyone else who may be affected by their actions or omissions.

### Equipment
NetNodes will provide workers with the necessary equipment and materials to undertake their role for example, stationery, computer, printer and telephone as funding permits. An inventory of all equipment provided will be kept by the employee's manager. All equipment and furniture provided by us will remain the property of NetNodes at all times. NetNodes is authorised to visit the worker at home to maintain, check and update any equipment issued and also to ensure that this is suitable and is being used correctly.

Workers are expected to ensure that proper care is taken of the equipment and materials provided by NetNodes. To avoid security problems and to protect employees from additional tax liabilities, all equipment provided by us may be used by the employee only, and only for work purposes, unless otherwise agreed. 

Should a worker leave the employment of NetNodes they are contractually required to return all equipment and materials and any other property of NetNodes. The organisation reserves the right to deduct the cost of any NetNodes equipment or property that is not returned or is returned in a damaged condition due to the workers’ actions.

### Telephone and Broadband

Home-based workers are responsible for ensuring that they have adequate broadband and telephone facilities at home. Mobile phones sometimes provided for employees. If the employee incurs landline expenses e.g. because of essential calls and poor mobile signal, these will be reimbursed against an itemised phone bill through our Expenses policy.

### Risk assessment

A risk assessment will be carried out by the employee’s line manager and employee for each home worker. This will take into account any personal characteristics (e.g. disability, location of home). Completing a risk assessment involves identifying the hazards relating to the home worker’s work activities and deciding whether enough steps have been taken to prevent harm to them or to anyone else who may be affected by their work. A risk is the chance, great or small, that someone will be harmed by a hazard. A hazard is anything that may cause harm. 

Prior to starting working from home, the employee's manager will send to the employee and receive back from the employee the Risk Assessment, Homeworking checklist and Display Screen Equipment checklist (this is the [It’s a setup](https://openerg.com/dse/setup.html) section of the [Open Ergonomics safe office practice](http://openerg.com/dse/index.html)) and will ask the employee to supply photos of their workspace and computer set up. They will then arrange a phone call during which the proposed workspace will be discussed, the risk assessment undertaken and any relevant training needs identified. This also provides an opportunity to discuss the implications of home working for the employee personally and for any third parties. Employees will be asked to re-submit a Homeworking checklist and Display Screen Equipment checklist annually and photos for review whenever they move house or when the workstation or equipment is changed.

It is specified within the employee’s contract of employment that they agree to accept visits from a representative of NetNodes at their home. Visits will be at times agreed in advance with the employee and typically to discuss work related matters such the delivery and collection of work, performance, health and safety, the installation or service of NetNodes equipment and any other work-related topics.

### Electrical equipment

Any electrical equipment provided by us will be visually inspected at least annually by our employees as part of their workstation reassessment. Home workers are required to use our equipment as instructed and immediately report any equipment defects to their line manager.

### Fire hazards

The following safety rules apply with respect to fire: 

- All home workers are advised to install one or more smoke alarms.
- Electrical equipment should be switched off at night and when away from the home.
- If an unaccompanied home worker smokes whilst working in his/her home, the usual fire precautions should be taken and cigarettes or matches should not be discarded into waste paper baskets.
- A clear exit that is not obstructed by bags, furniture or boxes should be maintained at all times.
- Where there are fire extinguishers, these should be kept in an appropriate position and maintained regularly. 

### Smoking

The ban on smoking in the workplace does not extend to workers who work unaccompanied in their homes; however it does apply where workers are visited on business. 

Home workers are therefore required not to smoke whilst a colleague, supplier or client is visiting their home on business. 

### Manual handling

Home workers should not lift heavy or awkward items by themselves and should take care to avoid the risk of injury by lifting any objects properly and asking for help, if available. Where help is not available, the load should be reduced where possible and all sensible precautions taken to minimise risk to the individual. 

### Housekeeping

Home workers are required to:

- ensure that they have adequate workspace, either in a separate room in the house or a separate work area, where they will be free from non-work related interruptions or distractions
- ensure that there are no trailing leads that they might trip over
- keep work areas free of clutter as much as possible
- ensure that their work area is maintained to work in a safe and healthy environment
- ensure that lighting, heating and ventilation are adequate.

### Accidents and first aid

All home workers will be provided with a first aid kit and should ensure that this is stored in an appropriate place and kept well stocked. Depending on the nature of the tasks, first aid awareness training may be organised for home workers, either prior to home working commencing or within the initial trial period. 

Accidents whilst at home which occur during working hours and in the course of undertaking the duties of the role should be reported in the same way as any that take place on our premises.

### Data security

Home workers are responsible for ensuring that the same standards of security of information and equipment that would apply in the office are maintained. 

Your line manager will advise on the security measures that must be taken to protect the information used by the home worker. This may include locking devices for computer equipment and making arrangements for the disposal of confidential waste. 

### Personal security

It is our policy that that home workers do not use their own homes for meetings with external parties such as service users or suppliers, but meet them at their premises or on neutral territory. Similarly, it is our policy to only share company phone numbers and email addresses rather than a home phone, personal emails or home address. 

When out of the office, the worker should always ensure that his/her travel plans and meetings are entered into either (a) their Google calendar (and that their calendar is shared with other members of their team) or (b) the ‘sharing-diaries’ NetNodes Slack Channel.  The calendar/channel entry should include the names, organisation, location and contact details of those they are meeting.

### Hours of work

Depending on the nature of the role and the hours of work defined in the contract of employment, home workers may have more freedom to organise their working times and breaks, or the work itself and how it is done. For this reason, it is important that workers and managers are clear as to the output required and the full range of work to be undertaken. 

Home workers are required to act responsibly regarding the total number of hours spent on any work activity. These should not be excessive and any concerns should be raised with their manager in the first instance. Where the working hours may vary, and in order that the worker receives a break from work calls/contact, we will agree times with the employee when he/she will be required to answer calls/emails from us. If requested, the home worker will be required to submit a timesheet confirming the hours worked, on a weekly/monthly basis. 

Equally, home workers are in a position of trust, are expected to work their full contractual hours and are reminded that home working is not an opportunity to undertake non-work related activities during working hours. They have the same obligations to work as other employees and should therefore make arrangements to ensure that their work is unhindered by domestic concerns. Dependant and child care arrangements must be in place to allow the home worker to work free from distractions. 

### Internal communications

It is recognised that home working is not ideal for everyone and that whilst we will aim to keep all home workers well informed of developments and changes in the business, some workers may feel isolated through the loss of regular contact with colleagues.
 
Home workers will be invited to attend team briefings and other team meetings on a regular basis. Copies of all circulars and notices, any internal vacancies and our newsletter will be emailed to each home worker.

The mental health of employees, like physical wellbeing, is important to NetNodes and if a home worker is feeling isolated, anxious or stressed, or think that they are becoming unwell they are encouraged to inform their line manager as soon as possible. NetNodes will work with the member of staff to provide support and aid access to appropriate mental health or counselling services. 

### Absence reporting and communications

A home worker who is unable to work (for example due to sickness) is required to follow our standard absence notification procedures. 

When absent due to sickness, holiday or other authorised leave, or the worker is unavailable for work, arrangements should be made to divert incoming calls and emails to an alternative point of contact within NetNodes. 

### Tax implications

The equipment provided by NetNodes is intended solely for business use, and provided this requirement is adhered to, home workers will not be subject to additional taxation. 

Provided that the employee is required to work from home, and the contract of employment makes this clear, any travel between home and client/customer sites, or for attendance at ad-hoc meetings at our premises, will be regarded as normal business mileage and may be reclaimed through our expenses procedure.

### Interested parties

Before starting home working, the worker should inform any party with an interest in his/her property of the intention to work from home. There may be terms or conditions, leases, restraints or covenants (for example in the mortgage or title deeds), which prevent working at home and it is the worker's responsibility to make appropriate arrangements. 

### Insurance

Home workers are required to ensure that their home insurance policy covers them for working at home, and should cover any furniture and equipment installed by NetNodes in their home. 

NetNodes will potentially be liable at all times for loss, damage or injury caused by furniture and equipment which we have installed, irrespective of who suffered the loss. We will not be liable for any loss, injury or damage that is not directly connected with the furniture or equipment that we have installed. Home workers must prevent unauthorised use of furniture and/or equipment belonging to NetNodes and all visitors should be supervised for this purpose.
 
### Expenses

Our normal expenses procedure applies to home workers. In addition it is recognised that it may be easier to purchase directly small essential items of stationery and other essential requisites through the expenses procedure. Such expenses will normally be reimbursed following the receipt of a properly authorised expenses claim form. 

### Individual review

A review of each individual's home working arrangements will be held at least annually or when significant changes occur, to ensure that they continue to operate effectively. Reviews may occur more frequently if the need arises. Home workers will be subject to our normal personal appraisal procedure and stress audit and additional training in IT skills, time management and organisational skills will be provided as required. 

If a home worker encounters any personal or domestic difficulties that prejudice the home working arrangements, he/she should inform his/her manager, who will then discuss the possibility of making alternative arrangements on either a temporary or permanent basis.

### Termination of employment

If a home worker is dismissed, we reserve the right to immediate access to the worker's home premises to collect any property or equipment belonging to NetNodes. 

In the event of resignation, agreement should be reached with the employee's manager regarding the return of property/equipment at a mutually agreed time.

### Implementation, monitoring and review of this policy
This procedure will take effect from 24th June 2023. The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for implementing and monitoring this procedure, which will be reviewed on a regular basis following its implementation and may be changed from time to time. 

Any queries or comments about this procedure should be addressed to your line manager.
