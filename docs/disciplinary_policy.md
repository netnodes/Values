## NetNodes Disciplinary Policy & Procedure

### Introduction

This Disciplinary Policy & Procedure does not form part of any employee's contract and can be amended and withdrawn at any time. 

NetNodes aims to be an organisation that values, recognises and responds to the diverse needs of members and those we serve. We adhere to the Equality Act 2010 and will not discriminate against any person or other organisation with particular reference to any of the protected characteristics.

### Purpose and scope

It is essential that certain standards of conduct and performance are maintained to protect the smooth running of NetNodes and the wellbeing of all its employees. The NetNodes Disciplinary Policy is intended to ensure fair and equitable treatment of employees where there are instances of misconduct or where job performance falls below an acceptable level.

All employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the effective and efficient operation of the organisation and should recognise and uphold high standards of conduct and performance in their dealings with each other, suppliers and members of the public who access our services. This Disciplinary Policy and its subsequent procedures therefore apply to all employees, irrespective of their length of service or role.

This Disciplinary Policy and Procedures is for guidance only, does not form part of employees’ terms and conditions of employment and is therefore not contractually binding. NetNodes reserves the right to amend this policy from time to time and where appropriate any changes will be communicated to and discussed with employees. Where appropriate, NetNodes aims to involve employees, and, where relevant, their representatives, in the development of this procedure.  This procedure does not apply to cases involving genuine sickness absence, or proposed redundancies.

### Principles

The procedure is designed to establish the facts quickly and to deal consistently with disciplinary issues.  No disciplinary action will be taken until the matter has been fully investigated.

Where an allegation of misconduct has been made or an employee appears to be under-performing, NetNodes' first step will be to establish the facts as quickly as possible. The extent of the investigation required will vary according to the particular circumstances, but it may involve holding an investigatory meeting with the employee. During this investigation into the facts, NetNodes reserves the right to suspend the employee from their duties on full pay, if this is deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances. Any such action will be confirmed to the employee in writing and kept under review. However, any investigation and/or suspension will be solely for the purpose of fact-finding and will not constitute disciplinary action. For the avoidance of doubt, no disciplinary decision will be taken until the disciplinary procedure detailed in this procedure has been followed. 

The employee will always be given written notice of an invitation to any disciplinary hearing of which they are the subject, and will be advised of the nature of the complaint against them, the circumstances that have led to us contemplating the need for disciplinary action and the procedure to be followed.

The employee will be given sufficient information and time to enable them to prepare a response. This may vary depending on the circumstances of each case but is not likely to be less than 48 hours. Copies of any written evidence will normally be provided in advance of the hearing.

Where the allegation(s) is sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, the employee will be informed in writing that dismissal may be the outcome of the meeting, but that no decision has been taken.

At every stage employees will be informed of what is alleged and have the opportunity to state their case.

An employee who is given a disciplinary warning will be told where their conduct or behaviour falls short of what we consider satisfactory, what improvement is required, and over what timescale this is to be achieved and how long that warning will remain current. An employee has the right to appeal against any disciplinary penalty.

### The Procedure

#### Informal disciplinary procedure

For less serious misconduct or where performance levels are below standard, NetNodes may issue an informal oral warning after conducting an initial investigation without using the full disciplinary procedure. Examples of less serious misconduct or performance are minor breaches of organisation discipline, poor behaviour, poor timekeeping or poor job performance.

An informal oral warning may be recorded on an employee's file by means of a file note. A letter of concern and/or action plan may be issued to the employee as appropriate, setting out the concerns, expected improvements and agreed timescale. The employee will also be informed that it may be necessary to move to the formal procedure (outlined below) in the event that the informal route is unsuccessful.

#### Formal disciplinary procedure

1. Right to be accompanied

	The employee will have the right to be accompanied at formal hearings by a fellow worker, a representative of a trade union (who must be certified in writing by that union as having experience of, or having received training in, acting as a worker's companion at disciplinary or grievance hearings), an official employed by a trade union, health care worker, CPN or Care Coordinator etc. The employee should tell the person conducting the hearing in advance whom they have requested to act as a companion. If the employee does not wish to be accompanied this will be noted.

	The companion is there to act as a witness to what is said, to provide moral support and to assist and advise the employee in presenting their case. The companion may address the hearing (provided the employee wishes this), ask questions on behalf of the employee and confer with the employee but not answer questions on behalf of the employee, nor may the companion prevent us from explaining our case. Fellow workers may not be compelled to attend as a companion. 

	If either the employee or their chosen companion is unable to attend any formal hearing under this procedure for a reason that was not foreseeable at the time the hearing was arranged, we will attempt to rearrange the hearing for a date within five working days of the original planned date. However, the employee is expected to take all reasonable steps to attend the hearing on the appointed date and at the appointed time. We reserve the right to make a decision in the employee’s absence based on the evidence available if the employee is unable or unwilling to attend a rearranged disciplinary or appeal hearing without good reason.

	Prior to the hearing, NetNodes will inform the employee which witnesses are to be called. 

2. At the hearing

	The person chairing the hearing (the disciplinary officer) will be accompanied by a suitable employee of NetNodes who will act as a witness and take full notes of everything that is said. Where no internal person of sufficient seniority or confidential status is available, or where preferred, an external party may be invited to attend in this capacity.

	If the employee is disabled, reasonable adjustments will be made to ensure that they are not disadvantaged at the hearing. This may include the provision of further assistance (e.g. a signer or other support) where necessary. Arrangements may also be made to assist any employee who does not have English as their first language and who may need an interpreter. 

	The disciplinary officer will outline the complaint against the employee and go through the evidence that has been gathered. The employee will be given the opportunity to present any information in their defence, explain or comment before any decision is made. Either party may ask questions, call witnesses, submit witness statements and also question any witnesses called by the other party. If the employee wishes to call any witnesses, they should notify the person conducting the hearing in advance. Witnesses cannot be compelled to attend. 

	A disciplinary hearing may be adjourned at any stage by the disciplinary officer in order to calm a tense situation, to check out facts or to take advice. Such adjournments will be kept brief wherever possible in order not to hold up the resolution of the hearing but may be extended where particular information needs to be checked in the interests of fairness or consistency. 

3. Making a decision

	Before making any decision on disciplinary action, the disciplinary officer will consider the evidence presented, take into account the employee's disciplinary and general record, any similar precedents, any mitigating circumstances or explanations given by the employee, what would be reasonable under the circumstances and whether any training, additional support or adjustments to the role or workload are necessary. 

### Disciplinary sanctions

#### Verbal warning – for misconduct, or poor performance or attendance of a relatively minor nature 

If the employee’s conduct, performance or attendance does not meet acceptable standards, they will normally be given a formal verbal warning and advised of the reason for the warning, that this is the first stage of the disciplinary procedure, how long the warning will remain current and of their right of appeal. 

#### First written warning (or improvement note) – for incidents of misconduct or poor performance/attendance

For general misconduct or poor performance/attendance or there is further misconduct, or poor performance or attendance within the duration of the verbal warning, a written warning (or improvement note, in the case of incapability) will be given to the employee. This will give details of the complaint, the improvement required and the timescale. The warning will also set out how long it will remain current. It will warn the employee that, if there is no satisfactory improvement, further disciplinary action may be taken and it will advise the employee of their right of appeal. 

#### Final written warning – for further misconduct or poor performance/ attendance, or if an incident of serious misconduct occurs

If there is still a failure to improve conduct, performance or attendance, or if an incident of serious misconduct occurs, a final written warning will normally be given to the employee. This will give details of the complaint, will warn that dismissal will result if there is no satisfactory improvement, and will advise of the right of appeal. The warning will also set out how long it will remain current.

### Dismissal with notice

If conduct, performance or attendance is still unsatisfactory and the employee fails to reach the prescribed standards, dismissal will normally result. The employee will be provided with written reasons for dismissal, the date on which their employment will terminate (in accordance with the employee's notice entitlement), and will be notified of their right of appeal. 

### Gross misconduct

An employee will not normally be dismissed for a first incident of misconduct, unless it amounts to gross misconduct. Certain offences may be regarded as so serious as to render the employee liable to summary dismissal without prior warning (see examples below – these examples are not exhaustive but are a guide to the type of offence which normally results in summary dismissal). A summary dismissal for gross misconduct will only be made following a disciplinary investigation and hearing and will be confirmed in writing, giving the reasons for dismissal, confirming that the employment terminates immediately without notice or pay in lieu of notice, and outlining the employee's right of appeal. 

- Refusal to carry out a reasonable instruction;
- Breaching NetNodes' policies and procedures;
- insulting, indecent or offensive behaviour; 
- theft or attempted theft; 
- damage to property; 
- fraud, cheating or taking a bribe; 
- incapacity for work due to being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs; 
- physical violence; 
- bullying and/or harassment; 
- conduct which causes, or has the potential to cause, serious reputational or public harm to NetNodes; 
- safeguarding breaches; 
- gross insubordination; 
- a criminal offence while employed which renders the employee unsuitable to carry out their duties; 
- a serious breach of data protection or confidentiality and/or committing any other offence of a similar gravity to the examples above.

While the alleged gross misconduct is being investigated, the employee may be suspended, during which time he or she will be paid their normal pay rate.  Any decision to dismiss will be taken by the employer only after full investigation and a disciplinary hearing, at which the employee has had an opportunity to comment on the allegations. 
	
For the avoidance of doubt safeguarding breaches are an act of gross misconduct and will result in summary dismissal. 

### Penalties other than dismissal

There may be circumstances where we consider alternative disciplinary action to dismissal to be appropriate. At NetNodes' discretion, such action could include suspension without pay, demotion (which may result in a reduction in pay for the employee), or alternative work elsewhere in the organisation, if any suitable posts are available. Demotions or transfers to a different post will only be considered in exceptional circumstances; where the employee agrees to a change of duties including a demotion and a reduction in salary/benefits commensurate with a revised role this could be an acceptable outcome of a formal disciplinary procedure.

### Duration and removal of warnings

Warnings and improvement notes will remain 'active' for the following periods unless a different period is confirmed in writing to the employee: 

**verbal warning**: 6 months from the date the warning is notified to the employee or such other period as may be specified 

**first written warning (or improvement note)**: 6 months from the date the warning/improvement note is notified to the employee or such other period as may be specified

**final written warning**: 12 months from the date the warning is notified to the employee or such other period as may be specified or indefinite, depending on the circumstances resulting in the warning 

A copy of the written confirmation of any warnings, improvement notes, dismissal, suspension or other disciplinary penalty (plus any appeal documentation) will be given to the employee and a copy placed on the employee's personnel file. Such documentation will be regarded as confidential.

Following completion of the appropriate period, the warning or improvement note will no longer be active and will normally be disregarded for the purposes of any future disciplinary action. Records of disciplinary sanctions will however be retained on file for purposes of disclosure as required by Regulation 11 of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (Amended 2014). 

### Authority to give disciplinary warnings, improvement notes and to dismiss

The following are authorised by NetNodes to give warnings, improvement notes or to dismiss: 

**verbal warning**:  any manager, director or trustee

**first written warning or improvement note**: any manager, director or trustee

**final written warning**: any manager, director or trustee 

**dismissal or other penalty such as disciplinary transfer or demotion/loss of pay**: any director or trustee 

### Appeals 

An employee who wishes to appeal against any disciplinary decision must do so in writing to the Director or their nominee (normally line manager) within seven calendar days of your receipt of our letter detailing the disciplinary, stating the grounds upon which they intend to appeal.

Once notice of an employee’s appeal has been received, NetNodes will, within five working days, give the employee written notice of a date, time and place of the appeal meeting. The employee will be entitled to be accompanied at this meeting by their Chosen Companion.

A Panel of NetNodes Board members (none of which took part in the original disciplinary proceedings) will hear the appeal and decide the case as impartially as possible.

The decision of the appeal chairperson will be given to the employee in writing after the meeting.  The chairperson’s decision is final, and there is no further right of appeal.

### Probationary employees

Employees who are still within their probationary period are not covered by this procedure. If there are instances of misconduct the probationary employee will normally be seen by their line manager, informed of any shortcomings in their conduct or behaviour, offered training and support (where appropriate) and warned that failure to improve will result in dismissal. If there is doubt about the employee's ability to reach a satisfactory standard of conduct of behaviour, the probationary period may be extended, in which case the employee will be told of this and a new date set for the expiry of the probationary period. 

If the employee is unable to reach a satisfactory standard of conduct, they will normally be invited to a formal meeting (with the right to be accompanied) prior to a decision being taken concerning their continued employment. This could result in their employment being terminated with notice (or pay in lieu of notice).

A probationary employee who commits an act of gross misconduct will be summarily dismissed. 

### Monitoring and review

The NetNodes Board will regularly review the operation of this procedure.
